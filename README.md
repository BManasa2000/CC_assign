# CC_assign
Compiler construction assignment

For the parser code, run the final.py file.
For the intermediate code, run the inter_final.py file.

P.S: Intermediate code
1. Was trying to implement for relational and conditional expressions, wasn't able to complete it. Will have to add attributes in order to do it. Can't use just temp and code.
2. Need to fix the grammar for arithmetic expressions. Currently the expressions of the form (E) are not working as expected.
